# linuxOnStuff - obsolete

This section is currently here for reference.

The original intention was to provide documentation and utilities for various platforms. That is what the structure in here reflects.

But over time it evolved into a single lightweight utility that can run everywhere. - Hence the change in structure. I may re-introduce a dedicated documentation section in the future for solving problems if it fits with where this repo is heading.
